The final assignment for Design course:

We were tasked to design a gearbox that will be used to transfer torque from an electric motor to a conveyor belt. To complete the subject we have to do preliminary calculations, checking calculations, which was made using an Excel file the professor gave us, and make a technical drawing of one of the 3 shafts in the gearbox. I decided to draw the countershaft and when we present our drawing to the professor, he expect us to explain why it is designed the way it is and how it will be locked axially and radially, how it will be sealed and assembled.
