Silver Arrow is the name of the rocket our team, Team 420, designed to participate in a rocket building competition called Czech Rocket Challenge. The launchday of the competition was on 10th of June 2022. The team consisted of Lukas Mican, who was the team leader, Matej Havir, Hai Anh Nguyenova, Gustavo Maldonado and me, of course.

We launched the rocket stably but unfortunately our parachute did not come out. I believe it did not come out because of the release mechanism we decided to use which relies on the smoothness of the inside surface of the rocket body. We were not able to sand the inside of the rocket thoroughly because of some last minute changes and was hard to reach some parts of the body as the final design of the rocket was longer than the initial design. We will make sure to avoid last minute chnages next time to avoid this kind of mistake from happening again. You can watch the launch of the rocket in the documents section.
