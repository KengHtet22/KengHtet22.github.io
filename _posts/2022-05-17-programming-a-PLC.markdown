Semestral project from Programmable Controller Applications course:

We were tasked to program a Programmable Logic Controller(PLC) from Siemens called SIMATIC S7-1200 using TIA Portal to carry out a sequence of commands depending on the type of project assigned to us. I was given a porject that involves sanding two arms of an U-shaped casting. We had to come up with a program that does what is given to us in the Project Description and build it in person in the lab as you can see below.
